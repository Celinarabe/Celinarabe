## Celina Rabe 

👋 Hi There! I am a self-taught Android/Web Developer working towards my first entry level role. I enjoy solving real world problems and being active within the Tech Community (Follow me on Twitter for #100DaysofCode content!).

Previously, I was a Cybersecurity Analyst at a Fortune 500 Company. I have a degree in Business Administration with a minor in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin.

## Passion Projects

### Sign Tracker
I was inspired to create Sign Tracker while volunteering for a political campaign. One of our biggest pain points was managing and storing the location of all of the yard signs and marketing materials. My solution, Sign Tracker, removes the need for manual entries, and allows for easy collaboration in the cloud. Visit Here.
