## Passion Projects

### Sign Tracker
I was inspired to create Sign Tracker while volunteering for a political campaign. One of our biggest pain points was managing and storing the location of all of the yard signs and marketing materials. My solution, Sign Tracker, removes the need for manual entries, and allows for easy collaboration in the cloud. [Visit Here] (https://sign-tracker-a5630.web.app/)
