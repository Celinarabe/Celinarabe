## Celina Rabe 

👋  Hi There! I'm Celina, a self-taught Android Mobile Developer. Previously, I was a Cybersecurity Analyst at a Fortune 500 Company. I have a degree in Business Administration with a minor in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin.

🌱  I’m currently learning Android Development in public. Follow me on Twitter (@Celina_kimm) for #100DaysOfCode content!

💬  Ask me about resources for self-taught devs (Web or Mobile). With so many online resources, the self taught journey can get overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be 😊

## Passion Projects

### Sign Tracker
I was inspired to create Sign Tracker while volunteering for a political campaign. One of our biggest pain points was managing and storing the location of all of the yard signs and marketing materials. My solution, Sign Tracker, removes the need for manual entries, and allows for easy collaboration in the cloud. [Visit Here] (https://sign-tracker-a5630.web.app/)
